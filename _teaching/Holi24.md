## Special Topics in High Speed Networks (COL867)


### Course Description 

Recent years have seen a growing trend of using machine
learning (ML) across various domains, and computer networking is no exception.
This course will focus on applications of ML for diverse networking tasks,
delving into the research problems associated with building end-to-end ML
pipelines for computer networking. These include problems related to data
collection, preparation, and data representation; design, development, and
evaluation of ML solutions; as well as scalability, explainability, and
robustness of ML models. We will study these topics through example ML
solutions proposed for different network tasks such as application performance,
resource management, and network security. 

By the end of this course, you will have learned about the latest in using ML
for networking. The course also includes a substantial hands-on component with
the goal of providing practical experience in applying ML to real-world network
datasets and understanding the related practical challenges

### Format

The course will run in a seminar style with a combination of
lectures on concepts and student presentations on research papers. Some
lectures will also have hands-on tutorials and there will be coding assignments
based on those tutorials. In addition, the students will do a project (in teams)
either of their own choice or based on ideas provided by the instructor. 

### Prerequisites
Students must have taken the undergraduate-level networking
course (COL334/672) or its equivalent. Also, it will help if the students have
already taken the undergraduate-level course on machine learning (COL341).
