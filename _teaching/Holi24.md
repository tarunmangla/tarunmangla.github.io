# Special Topics in High Speed Networks (COL867)

**Location**: LH603 \
**Time**: MW (11-11:50a), Th (12-12:50p) \
**Credits**: 3-0-4 

## Course Description 

Recent years have seen a growing trend of using machine
learning (ML) across various domains, and computer networking is no exception.
This course will provide an overview of the latest in using ML for networking. 
The first few weeks will focus on specific use cases of ML in networking such
as in the domain of resource allocation, application performance prediction, 
and resource allocation. Later part of the course will delve into the research 
problems associated with building (task-agnostic) ML pipelines for computer 
networking. These include problems related to data collection and representation 
as well as benchmarking, robustness, and explainability of ML models. 

## Objectives
- Understand research challenges in ML pipelines and opportunities in integrating
  ML techniques into networking
- Hands-on training by implementing ML solutions for specific network tasks


## Prerequisites
- COL334/672 or its equivalent
- COL341 (Preferred)

## Grading
- Exams (35%)
- Assignments (30%)
- Project (20%)
- Quiz (15%)

## Syllabus (Tentative)

We will first study specific ML solutions proposed for the following network tasks: 
- Module 1: Traffic Classification
- Module 2: Resource Allocation
- Module 3: Application Performance Estimaton
- Module 4: Security

Next we will delve into the task-agnostic ML pipelines for networking. 
- Module 5: Data Collection
- Module 6: Data Representation
- Module 7: Evaluation 
- Module 8: Explainability
- Module 9: Synthetic Data Generation

## Course Policy
- **Honor Code**: The course will follow the [IIT Honor Code](https://academics.iitd.ac.in/sites/default/files/registration/forms/10_FORM%20H.pdf)
- **Late Policy**: Students are provided with a grace period of 72 hours for the
semester. The grace period is counted in a granuality of hours. For instance, if you submit an assignment 1h30m past
its deadline, 2 hours will be subtracted from the grace period. No late penalty is provided as long
as you have a positive grace period balance. After the grace period expires, your credit for the assignment
will be halved if it is submitted within a week after the deadline. No credit will be provided
for later submissions. You still need to submit all the assignments to pass the course. 
- **Audit Policy**: You need to score a B grade to get an audit pass. Also, you need to turn in assignments
and projects for audit pass. 
- **Quiz**: There will be surprise quizzes. 6 (tentative) quizzes and the best 5 will be counted towards
final grading.
