I am a PhD student at School of Computer Science in Georgia Tech. I am advised by [Prof. Mostafa Ammar](www.cc.gatech.edu/~ammar) and [Prof. Ellen Zegura](www.cc.gatech.edu/~ewz). Before starting my PhD, I obtained my bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.

My work has been in the broad area of networking and systems with a focus on using passive network measurements to infer, troubleshoot, and manage end-user video quality of experience. I am also interested in using computing, particularly data science, to address problems of social relevance.
