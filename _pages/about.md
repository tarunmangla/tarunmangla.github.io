Science and Engineering Department at IIT Delhi. Prior to that, I was a
Postdoctoral Scholar at University of Chicago working with [Nick
Feamster](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/). I completed my PhD in
2020 at Georgia Tech where I was advised by [Mostafa
Ammar](www.cc.gatech.edu/~ammar) and [Ellen Zegura](www.cc.gatech.edu/~ewz). I
obtained my bachelor's degree in CS from IIT Delhi. </span>
